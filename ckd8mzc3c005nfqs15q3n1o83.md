## Announcement

It's technically my second story but it seems, fortunately enough, there's something wrong with the first one and hopefully, no one will ever see it. 

I'm here now after a workshop about creativity recovery. It's based on a book by Julia Cameron (artist's way) and this week, we're supposed to do some kind of fasting. What would be the food we should avoid? Social media and anything we deliberately use to kill time and avoid doing what we must do. And what defines this 'must'? It's actually what we always wanted to do but it seemed we never could manage to find the time for. 

I'm at the beginning of my journey toward a data science career and reaching this destination made me enroll in this weekly workshop. I needed to find the underlying causes of not proceeding with anything, even if they are very interesting. So far, I have realized the unbalance between my personal and my professional life. It seems I always have time for others, people that I care about or even the ones I don't that much. But spending time with people has always been really easy, as much as it turns out to be just wasting time. This is one of many things that prevents me from engaging in professional work. But it's changing and this weblog would be an evidence and record to it. 

I still don't know what my plan is for this place, but I'll start with anything that catches my eye about productivity. Maybe later I can share some interesting stuff about data too. By the way, I'm looking for a topic for my master thesis (poooffff, right?), so I may talk about that. 

Anyways, keep safe and wear mask outside!
